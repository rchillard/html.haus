    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Website for teaching HTML to everyone. I conceived of this website after
      returning to web development from a long hiatus. I used this project to learn HTML5 alongside ReactJS, but while
      doing so, I noticed an old problem has resurfaced in the new world: HTML is often misunderstood and misused. For
      example, there's an ugly proliferation of div tags! Div tags have no semantic meaning, yet many sites seem to use
      them for everything, often in place of proper semantic tags. This website hopes to fix problems like that by
      educating web developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern user interface libraries and frameworks like Angular, React, Svelte, and Vue are increasingly being used to
      build web applications. This abstraction on top of the web's view layer supports building applications in
      components. Component driven development has been growing in popularity for years, because it makes reasoning
      around and maintaining complex user interfaces easier. This new paradigm represents forward progress for how
      frontend developers build applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this abstraction has also taken developers a step away from the raw interface of the web, HTML and CSS.
      With that distance can come a loss of understanding what purpose HTML serves, why semantic HTML matters, and how
      to combine HTML elements for great justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML.Haus helps train everyone on these topics.
