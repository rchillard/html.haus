    <h1>Willkommen</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the House of HTML on the internet. Stay a while and read on.</p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and although it's not a programming
      language, it is the foundation of the web.  HTML is called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em> regular text 
      to specify structure.  It's the wood, steel, and concrete that frames every website and web application.  It's the skeleton that 
      the rest of the web builds upon to define meaning and present information.

      Everything is built on top of HTML's foundation.  If you want to learn how to build on the web, you have to start with HTML.

    <h2>Haus</h2>
    <p>
      Haus is the German word for house.  It comes from Middle High German hūs, and it's pronounced /haʊ̯s/.
