    <p>What is this website and why does it exist?</p>
    <p><strong>Web development has a big problem.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Modern user interfaces are built with libraries and frameworks that abstract away the web's view layer.
      This abstraction has obfuscated many web developers from the raw tools used to build interfaces on the web: HTML and CSS.  With that distance 
      can come a loss of understanding what purpose HTML serves, why semantic HTML matters, and when to properly use HTML elements for great justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML.Haus harkens back to web development fundamentals by offering resources for writing better HTML.
    </p>
    <p>Stay a while and read on.</p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and although it's not a programming
      language, it is the foundation of the web.  HTML is called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em> regular text 
      to specify structure.  It's the wood, steel, and concrete that frames every website and web application.  It's the skeleton that 
      the rest of the web builds upon to define meaning and present information.

    <h2>Haus</h2>
    <p>
      Haus is the German word for house.  It comes from Middle High German hūs, and it's pronounced /haʊ̯s/.  You can hear it here:
