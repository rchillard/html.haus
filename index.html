      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and although it's not a programming
        language, it is the foundation of the web.  HTML is called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em> regular text 
        to specify structure.  It's the wood, steel, and concrete that frames every website and web application.  It's the skeleton that 
        the rest of the web builds upon to define meaning and present information.

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>What is this website and why does it exist?</p>
      <p><strong>Modern web development has a problem.</strong> Websites and web applications are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, yet more properties are 
        increasingly being built with only JavaScript libraries and frameworks, which abstract away HTML and CSS.  This abstraction has distanced many web developers
        from the web's view layer.  With that distance can come a loss of understanding what purpose HTML serves, why semantic HTML matters, and when to properly
         use HTML elements for great justice.
      </p>
      <p>HTML.Haus harkens back to web development fundamentals by offering resources for writing better HTML.</p>
