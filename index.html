    <h1>Willkommen</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the House of HTML on the internet. Stay a while and read on.</p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and although it's not a programming
      language, it is the foundation of the web.  HTML defines the structure underlying the internet's content.  It's the wood and steel that frames every website and web
      application.  It's the skeleton that the rest of the web builds upon to define meaning and present information.  If you want to learn how to build on the web, you 
      have to start with HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>Haus</h2>
    <p>
      Haus is the German word for house.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, HTML Haus is your home for learning how to build websites using HTML by starting with the foundation, the structure, the bones of the internet. HTML Haus 
      is both a resource for learning HTML from scratch and a reference for advanced users including a template library that features best practices to help you get
      started on the right track using HTML properly to present both form and meaning.  Welcome home!
