    <h1>HTML Haus</h1>
    <p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web.  It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and although it's not a programming
      language, it defines the structure for the rest of the content on the internet.  It's the steel, wood, and framing of every website and web application.  It's the
      skeleton that the rest of the web builds upon to define meaning and present information.  If you want to learn how to build on the web, you have to start with HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haus is the German word for house.
