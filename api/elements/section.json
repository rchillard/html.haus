{"name":"section","description":"Stand alone section that is not represented by another more specific content section element. This is the          sectioning version of a div or span (generic, without specific semantic meaning), but should not be used in          place of a div. A section should still appear in a document outline.","code":"https://html.haus/api/elements/section.html","url":"https://html.haus/reference.html#section"}
