    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  Technically HTML is not a programming language.  It's called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em> regular 
      text to specify structure.  This is similar to how you would physically mark up an important passage in a book by underlining it.  When you write on the raw
      text in a book, you are adding semantic meaning to those words.  For example, when studying you might highlight or underline a word or phrase to draw attention
      to that passage or show its importance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same is true for markup in HTML.  You use HTML on the web to define the structure or 'mark up' the elements of a web page so that they have meaning beyond
       the text that is displayed.  These meanings follow rules and allow you to define your page in different elements.  Elements are the building blocks of a website.
    </p>
    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p>
      An element is a stand alone or discrete entity in HTML, which is usually denoted by two tags, a start or beginning tag and an ending tag.  These tags follow a certain
      syntax and they encase content to form an element.  Here's an element with denoted parts:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/element.svg" alt="diagram of basic html element <em> with start tag and end tag" height="160" width="351">
    <p>
      In HTML, the &lt;em&gt; tag is short for emphasis, and by convention, browsers usually render it in italics.  The tag above would appear like this on a web page:
    </p>
    <p><em>The haus is on fire!</em></p>
    Here's the raw HTML in an editable and easy to copy and paste format:
    <textarea><em>The haus is on fire!</em></textarea>
    <p>
      Another way to refer to the start of the element is as an opening tag, &lt;em&gt;, and a closing tag, &lt;/em&gt;.  Notice that the closing tag has a slash in it?
      This is standard HTML syntax, and you'll see that for all elements with a starting or opening (&lt;tagname&gt;) tag, and an ending or closing (&lt;/tagname&gt;) tag,
      they will follow this pattern.  In our haus metaphor, you can think of this kind of element as being the first brick or building material.
    </p>
    <h2>Text Content</h2>
    <p>
      The emphasis &lt;em&gt; tag helps us describe text content.  Remember that websites started as pages or documents, so text today is just as much a fundamental part of
      HTML and websites as it was in the early web.  You can denote text in two ways:
      <ol>
        <li>By creating a new paragraph or block of text</li>
        <li>By adding meaning to text in the same line</li>
      </ol>
      Creating a new paragraph means visually forming a new block on the page.  This is no different than hitting enter/return in your favorite text editor and starting to
      type.  These sorts of elements are referred to as block elements, because they represent structure and they create visual blocks.  The most common textual block element
      is the paragraph element.  You're reading one right now!
    </p>
    <p>
      I lied before because the &lt;p&gt; tag is really the first brick or building block in your world of new materials.  See how the &lt;p&gt; tag is here creating a new 
      visual block here, which is separate and apart from the surrounding content?  That's the purpose of this block level type of element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's the raw HTML in an editable and easy to copy and paste format:
    </p>
    <textarea rows="3"><p>I lied before because the &lt;p&gt; tag is really the first brick or building block in your world of new materials. See how the &lt;p&gt; tag is here creating a new visual block here, which is separate and apart from the surrounding content?  That's the purpose of this block level type of element.</p></textarea>
    <p>
      Adding meaning to text in the same line means adding semantic meaning through tags like <em>emphasis</em> &lt;em&gt; or <strong>importance</strong> &lt;strong&gt;.  
      These are less like bricks and more like your paint or lights, the parts of your haus that draw attention to certain elements and add special extra meaning to
      your basic text.  Of course, to really use your paint and hang your lights, you're going to need more structure.  You're going to need a wooden frame to hang the
      rest of your content on.
    </p>
    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>
      Headings serve as your framework, your wood, the sturdy dividers that the rest of your HTML haus can be built inside of and around.  Headings create new blocks of text,
      visually separate from surrounding elements, making them officially called a block element.  Can you guess what the 1st heading might be for?   Every page in HTML should have at
      least one heading, called an H1 (&lt;h1&gt;) that provides the title or main subject for that page.  After the H1, the rest of the headings flow down in a hierarchy, denoting the relative
      relationship between subordinate or nested content.  Headings allow you to see the same structure you'd experience in a table of contents.  Browsers will render headings
      by default as larger text, heavier (bolder) in appearance, and in a range starting from the largest, H1, and reducing down to the smallest, H6.  Here's what all the headings
      from 1-6 look like on this website:
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>h1</h1>
      <h2>h2</h2>
      <h3>h3</h3>
      <h4>h4</h4>
      <h5>h5</h5>
      <h6>h6</h6>
    </div>
    <p>
      It's important to remember that these headings are hierarchical, so it doesn't make any sense to represent a subordinate idea (&lt;h3&gt;) above a heading (&lt;h2&gt;)
      that is higher in the hiearchy.  Here's an example to demonstrate what I mean: 
    </p>
    <div class="container" style="background-color: lightcoral; padding: 1rem">
      <h1>The Fall of the House of Usher</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>Publication History</h3>
        <p>
          The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe was originally published in <em>Burton's Gentleman's Magazine</em> and <em>American Monthly Review</em> in 1839.
          Poe later republished the Gothic narrative in a collection of short stories called <em>Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque</em> in 1840.
        </p>
      <h3>Critical Acclaim</h3>
      <p>
        The short story is a tale of haunting tone that relies on an unnamed narrator to convey a sense of unsettled fear.  It is largely regarded as an <strong>American Gothic 
        masterwork</strong>.  In its time, it was criticized for being too formulaic, relying on similar themes and structures as some of Poe's earlier work.  However, it also 
        influenced later works of literature such as the character Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's <em>Moby-Dick</em> (1851).
      </p>
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was --but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me --upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain --upon the bleak walls --upon the vacant eye-like windows --upon a few rank sedges --and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees --with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium --the bitter lapse into everyday life --the hideous dropping off of the veil...
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The example above is about a famous work of literature, but the way we categorize and compartmentalize information follows a hierarchy.  The title of the story is the
        &lt;h1&gt;, the sections of the book are captured as &lt;h2&gt;s, because they are subordinate to the H1 and they help separate the editor's background information from 
        the actual story itself.  And then finally, even within the <strong>Background</strong> section, there's &lt;h3&gt; elements to denote sections of the background, Publication 
        History and Critical Acclaim.  All of these headings help communicate how ideas are related to one another.

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define
      its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to
      human users.
