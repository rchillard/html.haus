    <h1>Learn HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em>
      regular text to specify structure and meaning. This is similar to how you physically mark up an important passage
      in a book by highlighting. When you highlight part of a book, you are marking that part as important.
    </p>
    <img src="img/highlighted-text-600.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 95vw,
             (min-width: 600px) 90vw, 
             (min-width: 768px) 75vw, 
             (min-width: 992px) 60vw, 
             (min-width: 1200px) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="img/highlighted-text-600.jpg 600w,
               img/highlighted-text-900.jpg 900w,
               img/highlighted-text-1800.jpg 1800w,
               img/highlighted-text-2700.jpg 2700w" alt="Highlighted book by Hannah Busing on Unsplash">
    <p>
      HTML gives you the digital equivalent of a physical highlighter to mark up content. You use HTML on the web to
      define the structure or 'mark up' the
      elements of a web page so that they have meaning beyond the text that is displayed. These meanings follow rules
      and allow you to define your page in different elements.
      Elements are the building blocks of a website.
    </p>
    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p>
      An element is a stand alone or discrete entity in HTML, which is usually denoted by two tags, a start or beginning
      tag and an ending tag. These tags follow a certain
      syntax and they encase content to form an element. Here's a diagram of an element:
    </p>
    <img class="diagram" src="img/element-mark.svg"
      alt="diagram of basic html element <mark> with start tag and end tag" height="160">
    <p>
      In HTML, the &lt;mark&gt; tag is short for marked and browsers usually render it as highlighted text. Similar to
      the real world, marking something means you are
      referencing it or notating it for relevance or importance. The tag above would appear like:
    </p>
    <p><mark>The haus is on fire!</mark></p>

    <label>
      Here's the raw HTML in an editable and easy to copy and paste format:
      <textarea><mark>The haus is on fire!</mark></textarea>
    </label>
    <p>
      Another way to refer to the start of the element is as an opening tag, &lt;mark&gt;, and a closing tag,
      &lt;/mark&gt;. Notice that the closing tag has a slash in it?
      This is standard HTML syntax, and you'll see that for all elements with a starting or opening &lt;tagname&gt;, and
      an ending or closing &lt;/tagname&gt;,
      they will follow this pattern. In our haus metaphor, you can think of this kind of element as being the first
      brick or building material. The slash "/" in the
      closing tag is the mortar that seals the element, completing it and holding it in place.
    </p>
    <h2>Build to Learn</h2>
    <p>
      Before we go any further, as a part of active learning it's important to do exercises and practice, as well as
      read and comprehend. Actively exercising the new knowledge
      you just learned is what will actually ingrain that knowledge in your brain, making it accessible to you later on.
      For that reason, for every HTML element and new concept we
      learn, I highly recommend you type out the HTML. You can copy and paste the sample I provide, but typing it will
      help your retention. You will learn through this tutorial, but you should
      also build a sample page to go along with your learning. Build as you learn.
    </p>
    <h3>Basic Template</h3>
    <p>
      You don't need to understand all of this markup to use the template below, but it will help you get started
      faster.
    </p>
    <label>
      Open a text editor and copy and paste the contents below into a blank file:
      <textarea rows="10">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Playground</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <mark>The haus is on fire!</mark>
  </body>
</html>
        </textarea>
    </label>
    <p>Save the file as index.html and open it in your browser of choice. You should see your sample page!</p>
    <p>
      You already learned that elements start with one tag and end with another closing tag. As you can see above there
      are a lot of elements, including one called
      body. For now, all you need to focus on is that space between the body opening and closing tags. That will be your
      playground. As you go through parts of
      this tutorial, I will provide sample HTML for you. Feel free to transpose it manually by typing it between these
      tags and make sure you take the time to make
      it your own. Play around, customize your HTML, make it fun. This part is really important. Here are some ideas on
      pages you could build:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Synopsis of your favorite book</li>
      <li>Article dedicated to a band</li>
      <li>Personal biographical page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Choose a project, and as you learn HTML, utilize your new skills to build your own page. It will help the
      knowledge stick.</p>
    <h2>Text Content</h2>
    <p>
      The &lt;mark&gt; tag above helps us describe text content. Remember that websites started as pages or documents,
      and text today is just as much a fundamental part of
      HTML and websites as it was in the early web. You can denote text in two ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>By creating a new paragraph or <strong>block of text</strong></li>
      <li>By adding meaning to text <strong>in the same line</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Block Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Creating a new paragraph means visually forming a new block on the page. This is no different than hitting
      enter/return in your favorite text editor and starting to
      type. These sorts of elements are referred to as block elements, because they represent structure and they create
      visual blocks. Truth be told, I think these should
      probably be the bricks you use to start building. The most common textual block element or brick is the paragraph
      element. You're reading one right now!
    </p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/brickwall-600.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 95vw,

             (min-width: 992px) 60vw,

      alt="Red bricks peaking through white stucco wall by Gabriele Diwald on Unsplash">
    <p>
      I lied before because the p tag should really be the first building block in your world of new materials. See how
      the p tag is creating a new
      visual block right here, in this very paragraph, which is separate and apart from the image above and the next
      paragraph below?
      That's the purpose of this block level type of element.
    </p>
    <label>
      Here's the raw HTML from the paragraph above in an editable and easy to copy and paste format:
      <textarea
        rows="3"><p>I lied before because the p tag should really be the first building block in your world of new materials.  See how the p tag is creating a new visual block right here, in this very paragraph, which is separate and apart from the image above and the next paragraph below?  That's the purpose of this block level type of element.</p></textarea>
    </label>
    <p>
      All right, so you've learned how to start stacking bricks in the form of paragraphs, using the &lt;p&gt; tag, but
      what holds bricks in place? How do you give
      your house an underlying structure? You're going to need a wooden frame. You need headings.
    </p>
    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>
      Headings serve as your framework, your wood, the sturdy dividers that the rest of your HTML haus can be built
      inside of and around. Headings create new blocks of text,
      visually separate from surrounding elements, also making them block elements. Can you guess what the 1st heading
      might be for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every page in HTML should have at least one heading, called an &lt;h1&gt; that provides the title or main subject
      for that page. After the h1, the rest of the headings flow down in a hierarchy, denoting the relative
      relationship between subordinate or nested content. Headings allow you to see the same structure you'd experience
      in a table of contents. Browsers will render headings
      by default as larger text, heavier (bolder) in appearance, and in a range starting from the largest, h1, and
      reducing down to the smallest, h6. Here's what all the headings
      from 1-6 look like on this website:
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>h1</h1>
      <h2>h2</h2>
      <h3>h3</h3>
      <h4>h4</h4>
      <h5>h5</h5>
      <h6>h6</h6>
    </div>
    <p>
      It's important to remember that these headings are hierarchical, so it doesn't make any sense to represent a
      related subordinate idea (&lt;h3&gt;) above a superior heading (&lt;h2&gt;)
      that is higher in the hiearchy. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <div class="container" style="border: 2px solid #FF4500; padding: 1rem">
      <h1>The Fall of the House of Usher</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>Publication History</h3>
      <p>
        The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe was originally published in <em>Burton's Gentleman's
          Magazine</em> and <em>American Monthly Review</em> in 1839.
        Poe later republished the Gothic narrative in a collection of short stories called <em>Tales of the Grotesque
          and Arabesque</em> in 1840.
      </p>
      <h3>Critical Acclaim</h3>
      <p>
        The short story is a tale of haunting tone that relies on an unnamed narrator to convey a sense of unsettled
        fear. It is largely regarded as an <strong>American Gothic
          masterwork</strong>. In its time, it was criticized for being too formulaic, relying on similar themes and
        structures as some of Poe's earlier work. However, it also
        influenced later works of literature such as the character Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's <em>Moby-Dick</em>
        (1851).
      </p>
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively
        low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback,
        through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on,
        within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how
        it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say
        insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that
        half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural
        images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before
        me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant
        eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white
        trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more
        properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the
        bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil...
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The example above shows the way we categorize and compartmentalize information following a hierarchy. The title
      of the story is the
      &lt;h1&gt;, the sections of the book are captured as &lt;h2&gt;, because they are subordinate to the h1 and they
      help separate the editor's background information from
      the actual story itself. And then finally, even within the Background section, there's &lt;h3&gt; elements to
      denote subsections of the Background: Publication
      History and Critical Acclaim. All of these headings help communicate how ideas are related. They serve as the
      wooden frame, defining the structure of your content.
    </p>
    <p>

      alt="Japanese building with red wooden frame and white roof by T.H. Chia on Unsplash">
    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <p>
      In the House of Usher example above, you probably noticed that certain text appear in <i>italics</i> and other
      text appears in <b>bold</b>. You were introduced to this idea
      earlier with the &lt;mark&gt; tag, but we should circle back on why you use these elements now. Adding meaning to
      text in the same line means adding additional
      meaning through tags to emphasize text, mark importance, or notate references. These are less like bricks and more
      like your paint or
      lights, the parts of your haus that draw attention to certain elements and add extra meaning to your basic text.
      You probably also noticed that even
      though we are using elements in the text above, they're not creating new blocks like a &lt;p&gt; or &lt;h#&gt; tag
      might. That's because they're inline elements.
      Inline elements only effect text in the same line and do not alter the visual flow of the page or document.
    </p>
    <img class="diagram" src="img/inline-block-combined.svg" alt="diagram of p block element and strong inline element"
      height="160">
    <p>The book is an <strong>American Gothic masterwork</strong></p>
    <p>
      <label>The HTML used to display the text above:
        <textarea><p>The book is an <strong>American Gothic masterwork</strong></p></textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>
      You might notice that in our diagram the &lt;p&gt; tag is on different lines, while in the HTML above, the
      &lt;p&gt; tags are on the same line. That's because
      HTML ignores white space found outside of tags. Since the &lt;p&gt; element informs structure as well as meaning,
      you can add linebreaks between blocks of text
      in HTML and only a new set of &lt;p&gt; tags (or another block element) will actually render as a new line on the
      website's page. It makes it much easier to read
      HTML if you wrap the tag around the content and indent it properly, as the diagram shows above. This is
      particulary useful for long paragraphs of text.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far you've learned a handful of inline elements, which you can use to mark up your text with additional
      meaning:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;mark&gt; stands for marked and is used to notate importance in text and it typically displays as
        <mark>highlighted text</mark></li>
      <li>&lt;em&gt; stands for emphasis and is used to add stress to a passage and typically displays as <em>italicized
          text</em></li>
      <li>&lt;strong&gt; is used to to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency and usually displays as
        <strong>bold text</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course to really use your paint and hang your lights, you need to understand the rules around nesting elements.
    </p>
    <h3>Nesting</h3>
    <p>
      You're learning the tools you need to build your own beautiful haus out of HTML. So far you've learned about the
      bricks, the building blocks of any webpage, which are
      the block level text elements such as headings and paragraphs. You've also learned inline text elements as well,
      such as mark, emphasis, and importance. By combining these
      elements or materials, you can start to tell your own stories, to build a durable, digital House of Usher. You've
      probably already figured this out, but you can compose
      elements together by nesting them. It's important to close nested tags in order though. Here's what I mean:
    </p>
    <p>Luther Vandross was a talent, possessing <em>The Velvet Voice</em> and supporting lead singers across four
      decades.</p>
    <label>
      The HTML shows how tags need to be closed in order:
      <textarea><p>Luther Vandross was a talent, possessing <em>The Velvet Voice</em> and supporting lead singers across four decades.</p></textarea>
    </label>
    <p>
      When you nest an inline element like emphasis inside of another element like a paragraph, you have to make sure
      you close your emphasis tag before the paragraph tag.
      This simple rule will save you a lot of trouble and is worth remembering, as you'll be using elements together and
      nesting them often. Speaking of The Velvet Voice
      and soul music, it's important to also understand why you use tags like emphasis and how they change the meaning
      of a page beyond just the visual appearance.
    </p>

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>
      In soul music, there are ideas being communicated through the song that are beyond the simple words of the lyrics.
      Semantic HTML is a lot like that, because certain tags
      are used to identify content with an additional layer of meaning associated to it. Here's a formal definition from
      Wikipedia:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">
      Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and
      web applications rather than merely to define
      its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user
      agents.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Two examples you've already learned are the <em>emphasis</em> &lt;em&gt; and <strong>strong</strong>
      &lt;strong&gt; tags. The &lt;strong&gt; tag results in a visual
      difference, making the text it surrounds bold, but it also indicates that the text is also important. Why does
      this matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      The extra meaning added by the strong tag matters because of that last phrase above in the formal definition:
      <em>Semantic HTML is processed by... many other user agents</em>.
      One example of a user agent might be in a browser, whereby you're visually experiencing the content. However,
      other examples of user agents reading your webpage might
      come in the form of visually impaired people experiencing your webpage without a browser, instead through a screen
      reader; or even beyond people, computer programs
      like search engines will be reading your webpage and determining what is important about it (or not). In either
      case, by using the proper tags you convey
      semantic meaning about your house, which makes it easier for all users to consume your content.
    </p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Using proper Semantic HTML is closely related to the concept of accessibility and universal design. Universal
      design in building is the idea that all people should have equal access
      to a building, regardless of their level of mobility. That's why buildings have ramps for people in wheelchairs.
      The same is true for our digital world on the web. Any user, regardless of their situation, should have the same
      ease of
      access to your website as any other user. This includes users that are visually impaired and might use a screen
      reader or users that are hearing impaired and will need
      to read the captions on a video embedded in your site.

    <p>
      You've learned how to write a story. You can build a basic house using HTML, and now you understand why it's
      important to build that house for everyone. Let's start learning
      about how we might decorate our house, connect the rooms with doors and hallways, and give the place some
      character. I'm talking about HTML attributes.
    </p>
    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>
      An HTML attribute is an extra characteristic that you can add to a basic HTML tag which will enrich it with
      additional information about the tag. There are a few rules
      to follow when you're adding attributes to your HTML tags:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attributes are always specified in the start or opening tag</li>
      <li>Attributes generally come in a pair of two: a name and a value</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here's a visual example showing an attribute called style which you can use to change how your element is
      displayed.

    <img class="diagram" src="img/attribute.svg" alt="diagram of html style attribute for paragraph tag" height="160">
    <p>And here's how the actual HTML looks:</p>
    <p style="color: red">She's a brick haus!</p>
    <p>
      <label>The raw HTML used to display above:
        <textarea><p style="color: red">She's a brick haus!</p></textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>
      Color is a style property that defines a text element's font color. Red is a standard color defined in browsers.
      Combining the two on a &lt;p&gt; tag, we get a red paragraph.
      I know we promised this tutorial would be only about HTML, but you've actually just learned a little CSS as well.
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and if HTML
      is how you define structure and content with elements, then CSS is how you style an element's appearance and how
      each element displays in the browser. I know that's a lot,
      so don't worry about CSS right now. We'll work on that later.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're going to stick to HTML for now, but if you need a break, here's a link to a song to help you relax:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBx6mAWYPU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brick House</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking of links, a link (or hyperlink) is how you can define a door to another webpage. So far you've learned
      everything you need to build an HTML haus, but you're
      going to want to link your houses together. The link in the last paragraph is one of those doorways and it's
      defined by using an HTML attribute called href, which stands
      for hypertext reference. The href attribute is applied to an HTML element called an anchor tag &lt;a&gt;. It's a
      hypertext reference because it's referring to another
      piece of HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>The link above to The Commodores song looks like this in HTML:
        <textarea><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBx6mAWYPU">Brick House</a></textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, the href attribute has a value of "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBx6mAWYPU" which is the
      address to another website. It is applied inside of the opening &lt;a&gt; tag, and
      between the two tags, you see the text that has been marked up "Brick House". This is no different than using the
      &lt;mark&gt; tag, except this creates a link instead of a
      highlight. It's standard for browsers to display links as underlined text, which is how anchor tags usually
      render.
    </p>
    <p>
      For building your own website, you can link to another .html page on your computer by referencing it. It doesn't
      have to be on the internet. Your reference will
      follow the structure of your computer's file folders. Sometimes it's easier to see this with an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>Here's the index.html page with a link to a new page:
        <textarea rows="12">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Playground</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Here's a link to<a href="about.html">About Me</a>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
        </textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you see how the link above doesn't have an https:// in it? That's because it's a local reference to a file.
      Your site isn't on the internet yet;
      https is a protocol that the internet uses called Hypertext Transfer Protocol. I bet you can guess what it does!
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>Here's the about.html page:
        <textarea rows="14">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>About Me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm becoming a builder!  A budding web developer!</p>
    <p>
      Return to the <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
        </textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>For the example above to work, it's important that you have saved both index.html and about.html in the same file
      folder!</p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to anchor tags, the &lt;img&gt; tag stands for image and it references the location of an image. When you
      use this tag, it references the image's location and then your
      browser displays it for you to see. Instead of using the href attribute though, the img element uses the src or
      source attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>
        You can see an example here:
        <textarea><img src="img/red-house-150.jpg" alt="Red house on side of green hill"></textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <img src="img/red-house-150.jpg" alt="Red house on side of green hill by Luke Stackpoole on Unsplash">
    <p>
      The src="img/red-house-150.jpg" is referencing a file in relation to where my current HTML page that references
      the image is located. In this case, it's inside of a subfolder
      which is named "img" and the image is named "red-house-150.jpg". I was referencing an image on my computer, but
      you can also reference images on the internet by
      using their exact location. If you want to try, you can use the following address on your own HTML page:
      "https://html.haus/img/red-house-150.jpg"
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>
        Here's the HTML for you to try:
        <textarea><img src="https://html.haus/img/red-house-150.jpg" alt="Red house on side of green hill"></textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <img src="https://html.haus/img/red-house-150.jpg" alt="Red house on side of green hill">
    <p>
      You may have noticed another attribute attached to each of these images. Images have two required attributes: the
      src attribute and the alt attribute.
      The alt attribute is for alternate text and it should be a meaningful description of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember all those different users and user agents?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alt text is there for visually impaired users who rely on a screen reader to experience your webpage. Even though
      they can't see the image, they still need to be able to experience your page as if they could. Their
      screen reader will read the description you provide in your alternate text, so make sure you write a meaningful
      description there. Also, screen readers already know that it's an
      image, so there's no need to ever write "Photo of" or "Image of" in your alternate text. This is duplicative.
    </p>
    <h2>Self Closing Tags</h2>
    <p>
      You probably noticed that there's another peculiar thing about img tags. They don't have an ending or closing tag!
      There's no such thing as a closing &lt;/img&gt; tag,
      in fact it's bad HTML. That's because certain elements don't need a closing tag, because they stand alone without
      having to encompass anything else. In an image's case, there's
      nothing for the image to wrap around, because the image itself is the element. The extra ending tag wouldn't be
      useful. That's why it's a self closing tag.
    </p>
    <h2>Hanging the Roof</h2>
    <p>
      It's time to revisit where we started, bring it all together, and put the roof on your HTML haus.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of this tutorial, I shared a template without explaining it. I wanted to get you into building
      HTML as fast as I could, so we skipped a
      few basic parts. Before you finish, it's important to understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>
        Our starter template from the beginning:
        <textarea rows="10">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Playground</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <mark>The haus is on fire!</mark>
  </body>
</html>
          </textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>
      All HTML documents are wrapped in a parent &lt;html&gt; tag. Inside of the HTML element, there are two essential
      components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>head</li>
      <li>body</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The head element contains information about the document or page that is important for your computer's browser
      (and other user agents, such as search engines),
      but is not displayed to you visually as part of the page. As an example in the head tag above, there's a title
      element, which defines the text that appears in
      your browser's tab, giving a title to your page. There are many more elements that can go in the head, but title
      is the first one you should learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body element contains your actual page, and it's what you've been working in this entire time. HTML demands
      and requires that the body element follow the head
      and that the entire content of your webpage is captured inside the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to think of the &lt;head&gt; as being the the attic of your HTML house, where important things like ducts,
      wiring, and air conditioning units live, except
      in HTML these things are the title of your page, links to CSS styles, or maybe even metadata about your website.
      You never see what is in the attic, but the roof of
      the house is supported by the attic, so it still serves a very important purpose. Similarly, the body is the house
      itself, the part you experience as the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <p>
      Metadata in HTML can help you describe the author of the webpage or the description that should appear in search
      results. Think of this as additional information that
      other user agents might need in order to process, categorize, or understand your page correctly. Without delving
      too deeply into this, I recommend you read through the
      conclusion and then check out the References section for a peek into all the possibilities.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      You've just learned a whole heap of HTML. Actually, you've learned everything you need to recreate this tutorial
      yourself. You can go out and build your own site now.
      Here's what you learned by completing this one page tutorial:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What an HTML element is</li>
      <li>Different kinds of elements: block vs. inline</li>
      <li>How to structure text content using headings and paragraphs</li>
      <li>What Semantic HTML means and why you should write it</li>
      <li>The importance of universal design and accessibility</li>
      <li>What HTML attributes are and how they enrich elements</li>
      <li>How to create doorways to other pages using links</li>
      <li>How to hang pictures on your walls using images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In order to really absorb and retain this information, I recommend you follow a cycle of first learn, then build,
      and finally teach. Building this website, HTML.Haus, was part of my
      own study to learn HTML5 and fulfill the teach part of my cycle. Take the concepts you've learned today and tell
      your own story by building a webpage. The internet needs you. We need you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>
        Here's a template to get you started covering all the elements we learned together today:
        <textarea rows="13">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title Appears in Top of Browser Window</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Congratulations</h1>
    <p>I'm proud of you for learning HTML and building your very own <a href="https://html.haus/">HTML.Haus</a>.</p>
    <img src="https://html.haus/img/red-house-150.jpg" alt="Red house on side of green hill">
  </body>
</html>
        </textarea>
      </label>
    </p>
    <p>You can copy and paste this into a text editor and save the file as index.html. Loading that file in a browser
      shows your page!</p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Of course, there's a lot more to learn after this. You learned how to build a house today, but you can build
      veritable castles out of HTML. There are big parts of HTML that this
      introductory tutorial didn't cover, such as forms and tables, interactive elements, and metadata. To keep learning
      these additional areas, check out these other sections:
