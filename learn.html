    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  Technically HTML is not a programming language.  It's called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em>regular 
      text to specify structure.  This is similar to how you would physically mark up an important passage in a book by underlining it.  When you write on the raw
      text in a book, you are adding semantic meaning to those words.  For example, when studying you might highlight or underline a word or phrase to draw attention
      to that passage or show its importance.
    </p>

      The same is true for markup in HTML.  You use HTML on the web to define the structure or 'mark up' the elements of a web page so that they have meaning beyond
       the text that is displayed.  These meanings follow a set of rules and allow you to define your story in elements.  Elements translate into certain appearances
       by a defined set of standards.
