    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  Technically HTML is not a programming language.  It's called a markup language, because it's a way to <em>mark up</em>regular 
      text to specify structure.  This is similar to how you would physically mark up an important passage in a book by underlining it.  When you write on the raw
      text in a book, you are adding semantic meaning to those words.  For example, when studying you might highlight or underline a word or phrase to draw attention
      to that passage or show its importance.
    </p>
    <!-- Add image of marked up text here in raw book -->
    <p>
      The same is true for markup in HTML.  You use HTML on the web to define the structure or 'mark up' the elements of a web page so that they have meaning beyond
       the text that is displayed.  These meanings follow rules and allow you to define your story in elements.  Elements translate into certain appearance on your site.

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define
      its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to
      human users.
